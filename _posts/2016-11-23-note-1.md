### The Agency Problem

Separation of ownership from control.

#### Manager's maximized welfare

Managers,in practice, control on a day to day basis. Maximise own welfare by:
- salaries& ‘perks’ within reason
- empire-buildingthrough mergers and expansion to increase social status
- reducingrisk through diversification to improve own security

#### Managing the agency problem
- Managers have vested interest in promoting buoyant share price, or risk being taken over.
- Incentive schemes, e.g. bonuses tied to profits,  executive share options schemes.
- Stock market movements may, however, dwarf the efforts of managers!

### Government borrowing

- Failure to fund the gap by borrowing would result in inflation.

- The cost of supporting government debt is spread over the entire economy and passed to future generations. Consequently, governments are less sensitive to the cost of borrowing than companies.

### Feature of Government Bond

- In most advanced countries, government bonds are the oldest and largest source of bonds.
- They are designed to appeal to small as well as large investors: **having low or no credit risk**, **there are few restrictions on sales to small investors**.
- Large institutional investors buy bonds as a core part of their portfolio: **long maturities** are attractive to pension funds and life assurance companies.

### DERIVATIVES

- Forward contracts 远期合约 
  - fixes the price today, for delivery at some time in the future
  - a futures contract is a standardised version, traded on an exchange
  - 远期合约（forward contract）是买卖双方所签订的在未来指定的时间按照今日商定的价格购入或卖出资产的一种非标准化合约。远期合约是一种金融衍生工具 。远期价格和即期价格的差异为远期溢价或远期折价。远期溢价或折价可以视作买方的利润或亏损。远期合约可用于风险对冲（特别是汇率风险）或用于投机行为。
- Option contracts期权
  - enable the purchaser of the option to buy or sell the underlying share at given prices, if they so choose
  - it gives the holder the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell at the stated price
  - 期权又称为选择权（英语：Option），有时也看作是期货和选择权的合称。选择权是一种通常可交易的衍生金融工具，根据某项资产（如股权、股票指数或期货）在未来某一时间段的价格，确定期权交易中买家的权利和卖家的义务。 简单的说，期权指的是一种在一定期限内的交易选择权，也就是赋予了持有人一种按照约定价格买或卖的权利，但是持有人可以自己决定要不要行使这个权利。在期权的交易时，购买期权的一方称作买方，而出售期权的一方则叫做卖方；买方即是权利的受让人，而卖方则是必须履行买方行使权利的义务人。
  - 期权具“零和游戏”特性，而个股期权及指数期权皆可组合，进行套利交易或避险交易。
  - 期权主要可分为 Call option和 Put option，前者也称为看涨期权或认购期权，后者也称为看空期权或认沽期权。Call Option 的拥有者有权利、但没有义务，在约定的期间，以约定的价格，买下标的商品。Put Option 的拥有者有权利、但没有义务，在约定的期间，以约定的价格，卖出标的商品。


- Swap
  - a contract in which two parties agree to exchange one or more periodic payments in the future – e.g. interest rate swap

#### Three ways to value a firm:
Investors use a number of methods to determine the quality of a company’s shares.

- Market Capitalization

- P/E Ratio(price earning)

- Dividend Yield(dividend / price)

Book Value

- Networth of the firm according to the balance sheet.



Liquidation Value

- Net proceeds that could be realized byselling the firm’s assets and paying off its creditors.

Market Value

- The value of the firm as determined by investors who would be willing to purchasethe company.

#### Price and Intrinsic Value

$$
V_0=\frac{DIV_1+P_1}{1+r}
$$

$V_0$ means the **intrinsic value** of the share.

- Expected Return
$$
ER=\frac{DIV_1+P_!-P_0}{P_0}=0.12
$$

### undefinedThe Dividend Discount Model

$$
P_0=\frac{Div_1}{(1+r)^1}+\frac{Div_2}{(1+r)^2}+\cdots+\frac{Div_n}{(1+r)^n}
$$
